## Papers

### [4] From Earthquake Solidarity to Educational Equity: Conceptualizing a Sustainable, Volunteer-Driven P2
Keywords: +trust, persona
Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15432

**Relevance:** low
**Summary:** The study details the evolution of a volunteer-driven P2P educational ecosystem post-disaster, focusing on sustainability and scalability without addressing adversarial vulnerabilities or cognitive manipulation techniques.
**Attack Surface:** This paper does not address adversarial vulnerabilities in human decision-making, AI/LLM systems, or cognitive manipulation techniques directly.
**SCT Codes:** 
**Defense Implications:** The findings do not provide direct insights into improving cognitive/AI defense mechanisms.

### [3] Navigating the Ethical and Societal Impacts of Generative AI in Higher Computing Education
Keywords: +decision-making
Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15768

**Relevance:** medium
**Summary:** The paper discusses the ethical and societal impacts of Generative AI (GenAI) in higher computing education, focusing on issues like equity, academic integrity, bias, and data provenance.
**Attack Surface:** While the paper does not directly address adversarial vulnerabilities or attacks, it highlights potential risks that could be exploited through cognitive manipulation techniques such as biased information dissemination.
**SCT Codes:** SCT-023, SCT-045
**Defense Implications:** Findings can inform the development of more robust ethical guidelines and educational programs to mitigate bias and misinformation, thereby enhancing both human and AI resilience against cognitive manipulation attacks.
**Action Items:**
  - Update curriculum modules to include case studies on biased data in GenAI systems.
  - Develop training materials that teach students about recognizing and mitigating the effects of adversarial content.

### [3] Peaceful Anarcho-Accelerationism: Decentralized Full Automation for a Society of Universal Care
Keywords: +reinforcement learning
Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13154

**Relevance:** low
**Summary:** The paper discusses anarcho-accelerationism as a framework for decentralized automation but does not directly address adversarial vulnerabilities, AI attacks, or cognitive manipulation techniques.
**Attack Surface:** Does not explicitly discuss any vulnerability or attack vector related to adversarial techniques.
**SCT Codes:** 
**Defense Implications:** The paper's focus on governance and decentralization could indirectly inform defense strategies by highlighting the importance of robust governance structures in AI systems, but this is not a direct application.
**Action Items:**
  - Review decentralized governance models for potential insights into resilient AI system design.
